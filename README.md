======

Another 'learning by doing' project: Fiddling around with drag n'drop and SVG to create some type of trivial 'wire the terminals' toy.

Installation
------------

If you are at all interested: Just clone and crank up `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` in the cloned directory.

Comments
--------

Again, if you at all inerested: I'd welcome suggestions, advice and comments about using DnD and SVG paths as applied to wiring diagrams and best path analysis. Thank you.
