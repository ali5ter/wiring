Installation
------------

If you are at all interested: Just clone and crank up </code>python -m SimpleHTTPServer</code> in the cloned directory.

Comments
--------

Again, if you at all inerested: I'd welcome suggestions, advice and comments about using DnD and SVG paths as applied to wiring diagrams and best path analysis. Thank you.
